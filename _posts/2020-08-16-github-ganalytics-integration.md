I don't really know where to start with any of my projects. Rather than coming up with a giant procedural system to get the world up an going, my best bet is to just start with a simple project using this framework, and just get it up and running.

The project that I am thinking of is integrating a google analytics and github pipeline in a single data warehouse so I can do some analysis on these two tools. Before I write the first line of code, I need to come up with some acceptance criteria.

#### Objective

The basic objective is to build a tool stack that I can re-use in future projects without rebuilding the wheel. Prior to this project, I have been using Jira for project management, but it is really just a glorified todo list. I have already built an app to connect to the github api, so writing something new should build on that. Because I have a lot of problems with onboarding people to projects that I have built, I think my test should be to provide the service for free to 5 random people. I can test the setup on Erin, Deryck, Ben, Xu, and Micah but they are just the test case to see how hard it is to get them up an running. The true test is to:

 1) get jekyll up an running to write articles   
 2) get feedback on those articles using Google Analytics   
 3) create an issue to identify a story, bug, or task that needs doing *i.e. a todo*  
 4) close an issue  
 5) show how the closed issue affected the Google analytics  


#### Acceptance Criteria

The project can be seen as a success if 4 out of 10 people, who used the software for 4 weeks in a row, would be very dissapointed if we closed down our support for the tool stack.


#### Research 

Before building this, I need to test a few assumptions.
