A blog about philosophy, hard science, engineering, and software development. I'm interested in creating lessons on hard subject matter that can be quickly understood by anyone with at least a 7th grade level of education (not quite ELI5, but getting close). I also use this site as a reference for problems that have already been solved, so I don't have to reinvent the wheel everytime I pick up a new project, or want to help someone answer a question.

While many blog's might measure their effectiveness based on views, this blog is more of a journal of projects than a publishing platform. Therefore, success or failure of the blog will not be measure based on views, but on it's ability as a tool to provide a consistent place to measure progress. The measure shouldn't be a particular metric in and of itself, but a measure of the ability to measure change in a metric of one of the projects that I am working on.

Perhaps a good metric is the sum of all projects that effect at least a 1% return over a three month period.

`Î£ projects WHERE (value_end - value_0) / value_0 > 1%`
